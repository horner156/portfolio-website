		<h1>
		Hi, I'm Max.
		</h1>
		
		<p>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started programming during my freshman year of highschool and as of right now I am 2 semesters from graduation at Ohio State. In highschool, I was president of the Computer Science Club,
		 where we taught new students of Computer Science the basics of Java. I am now seeking a full time opportunity where more experienced programmers will offer me the same type of guidance.
		 Most of my programming experience is in Java and C#, but through my education at OSU I have used C and x86 Assembly extensively. As a student here, it is expected that I can work within new languages and frameworks, so I am prepared to adapt to anything. Check out the Projects page to see what I have been doing at OSU.
