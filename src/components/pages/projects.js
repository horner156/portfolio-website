		I Created this website from scratch in Javascript. I used React, Gulp, Sass, and Bootstrap in the process of creating this website. Additionally, I familiarized myself with Github and Github pages in order to host this page online.

		At OSU, I have completed many projects for my Computer Science class. One of these projects was an 
		implementation of a Java Class to represent all Natural Numbers using String as the data representation.
		There have been many more projects at OSU and I would love to talk about the skills I have learned from working on them, if interested, please contact me.
